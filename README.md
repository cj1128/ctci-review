## Intro

As a software developer, to be honest, I don't think mastering algorithm details or capable of coding in a white board matters that much. Engineers are supposed to stand on the shoulders of giants. We know what weapons we have and we wisely choose what to use. We don't have to know how to manufacture them.

However, we all have to do something we don't like. This is the cruel truth of life. Sometimes we have to be what others want us to be. So, here comes this repo. I am gonna solve all the questions in this book and write the process.

## JS

`yarn test`.

## Questions

### 1.1 Is Unique

> Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters. What if you can't use additional data structures?

- O(N): use a Set
- O(NLogN): sort and one traversal
